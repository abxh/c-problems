# Calculator

Create a calculator that supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators on numbers and parenthesised expressions. (Hint: ||Use shunting-yard + stack or an assembly-syntax-tree||)

## Places to test your solution
- [Basic Calculator II - Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)
- [Basic Calculator I - Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/) (Harder)
- [Calculator - Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems/calculator) (Harder)
- [Basic Calculator IV - Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-iv) (Very hard - my code can't solve this)

## Extra challenges:
- Store and allow the last evaluated value to be used with `_`.
- Parse floating numbers as inputs.
- Assume every operator is left-associative, and implement a power operator with `^`.
- Permit implicit multiplication between a number and parenthesised term and between two parenthesised terms.
